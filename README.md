# arduino-builder

Arduino-builder based CI container to package firmware.

This container is similar to
[`hexos/arduino-builder`](https://github.com/hexos/arduino-builder/ "Arduino Builder Source"),
except installations happen in a single command, and the build
essentials package is installed, exposing `make`.
